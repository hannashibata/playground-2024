                        <h6>Hanna&#8217;s design journey began over 10+ years ago as a student at Musashino Art&nbsp;University.</h6>
                        <h6>After starting her career as a packaging designer in Tokyo, she expanded her role into branding design as an in-house creative, where she forged and managed relations with agencies across continents. Eventually taking the leap to pursue her graduate studies at Pratt Institute, Hanna left Tokyo and has continued her career as an in-house Art Director in the United States. Culturally bilingual, her passion is creating bridges between Japan and North America through visual communication that transcends language and borders. When she&#8217;s not crafting at the computer, she loves taking walks with her Great Dane pup, Danton, or cooking up a&nbsp;storm.</h6>
